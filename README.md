# django-image

Django container:
GHCR
2 Major versions of Django at once
Each major version of Django will be pinned to a python version
Image needs to allow installing additional dependencies inside of it for each project, but should come with a comprehensive django base (CORS, mysql, pgsql, oauth package, poetry, gunicorn)
